## About
This repo stores files and data related to our research and journal article exploring spatial and racial group disparities of COVID-19 mortality.

**Question**: How do the associations between structural factors and COVID-19 mortality help explain the disproportionate outcomes experienced by different racial and ethnic groups?

**Findings**: In this cross-sectional study of 3142 counties in 50 US states and the District of Columbia, the associations between different measures of social determinants of health and COVID-19 mortality varied across racial and ethnic groups (Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, and non-Hispanic White populations) and different community types (rural, suburban, and urban areas).

**Meaning**: Findings from this study suggest the need for future research that addresses health inequity and guides policies and programs by further exploring the different dimensions and regional patterns of social determinants of health.
