This repo stores files and data related to our research and manuscript exploring Spatial and Racial Group Disparities of COVID-19 Mortality.

**Question**: How are social determinants of health (SDOH) associated with racial and spatial inequity in COVID-19 mortality?

**Findings**: In this cross-sectional study of 3,142 counties with approximately 325 million persons in 50 US states and the District of Columbia, different SDOH measures were found to be significant predictors of higher COVID-19 mortality across rural, suburban, and urban contexts.

**Meaning**: Different SDOH measures are associated with inequities in COVID-19 mortality in rural, suburban and urban areas. SDOH shape health in unique ways depending on a communityâ€™s rural, suburban, or urban context and racial/ethnic population makeup. Understanding these structural inequities is key for determining and implementing place-based interventions.
